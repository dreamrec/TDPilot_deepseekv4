"""Smoke tests for npm/brains.js — v1.4.5 hardening.

Drives the JS via node subprocess against an isolated HOME so the user's
real `~/.tdpilot-dpsk4/` is never touched. The bundled manifest is staged at
`<tmp>/.tdpilot-dpsk4/data/brains/brains_manifest.json` before each test.

Pins the regressions the reviewer identified in v1.4.4:

  - `brains add <unknown>` silently marked the id installed.
  - `brains add <local_build_id>` (no files) succeeded with zero
    downloads, polluting active.json without a usable DB.
  - Any typo in active.json disables all known brains at next startup
    (because active.json is an allow-list).

Note: As of v1.6 the shipping manifest contains no `local_build` brains,
so the local-build-specific regression tests have been retired. They
should be re-introduced if a future shipping brain re-uses that mode.
