"""v1.6.7: regression tests for the three build-script bugs that left the
panel showing "Ctn" placeholder on every fresh loadTox from v1.5.6 through
v1.6.6.

The three bugs (all in `td_component/build_*.py`):

1. ``state_cache`` textDAT is never created inside ``mcp_server`` —
   renderer.bootstrap silently returns False on every load, panel never
   gets populated. Fix in v1.6.7: ``_populate_component`` now creates
   it and bakes ``td_component/state_cache.py`` content into it.
2. ``autostart`` executeDAT created with all trigger toggles at default
   False — onStart, onFrameStart, etc. are defined as functions in the
   DAT but TD never calls them because no toggle says "fire this
   callback." Fix in v1.6.7: ``_create_text_dat_with_source`` enables
   the toggles for executeDAT.
3. ``status_text`` textTOP created without ``display=True``, so the
   containerCOMP's panel surface doesn't show it. Fix in v1.6.7:
   ``_create_status_text_top`` sets display + viewer flags.

Why source-text tests rather than runtime tests: the build script can
only execute inside a running TouchDesigner (it calls ``op()``,
``parent.create()``, etc.). A unit test outside TD can't actually run
the build. So we settle for the next-best thing: assert the SOURCE
contains the calls that fix each bug. If someone removes those calls
in a future refactor, this test fails — and CI stops them.

These tests are NOT a substitute for verifying the .tox itself works.
That verification happens via ``check_tox_freshness`` (CI) plus manual
panel inspection on every release.
