"""TDPilot DPSK4 autostart — disable auth, refresh installer state, tick panel.

Self-sufficient: this runs from inside the dragged-in / loaded tdpilot_dpsk4
COMP, so it does NOT depend on the launcher .toe's tdpilot_dpsk4_startup.py
having executed. Drop the .tox into any project and you get a working
panel without textport gymnastics.

onStart()       fires once on project load. Permanently disables MCP
                shared-secret auth (single-user local dev — see comment
                in _disable_auth). Then refreshes installer state and
                renders the panel's first frame.
onFrameStart()  refreshes the panel once per second, polls the
                installer's job state every frame to surface live
                progress, and executes any pending main-thread actions
                the installer's bg thread requested (e.g. project.save).

    Returns True if externaltox was set (and the future TD launches will
    auto-load fresh .tox content from disk), False if we couldn't set it
    (in which case the .toe still works, just embeds the current COMP
    content like before — the v1.6.5-and-earlier behavior).

    v1.6.6 architecture (closes the "panel still says 1.5.3 after restart"
    bug class permanently):

      Pre-v1.6.6: ``project.save`` baked the entire current /project1/tdpilot
      COMP (with whatever API_VERSION was current at save time) into the
      .toe file. Future TD launches restored that frozen content. To get a
      newer .tox into the running COMP required either (a) the v1.6.5
      Startup-script sweep (which fights TD's startup ordering — Startup
      scripts run BEFORE the .toe loads, so the sweep can't see /project1
      yet, and the .toe restore wipes whatever the sweep loaded into /local)
      or (b) a manual destroy + loadTox + project.save sequence (what the
      user had to do once via Textport to recover from the v1.6.4/5 mess).

      v1.6.6: before project.save, set the COMP's externaltox parameter to
      the on-disk .tox path. Then save WITHOUT saveExternalToxs=True so the
      COMP content is NOT embedded — only the path reference. Every future
      TD launch reads the latest .tox content fresh from disk.

      Net effect: a v1.6.6 user clicks "Update Now" once. From that point
      forward, ``npx tdpilot@latest`` + restart-TD = panel updates
      automatically. No manual sweeps, no Textport gymnastics, no ordering
      races. The Startup-script sweep (v1.6.5) becomes belt-and-suspenders
      defense for users whose .toe somehow gets out of sync.
