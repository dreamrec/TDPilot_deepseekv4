"""
TDPilot auto-load startup script for TouchDesigner.

Place in ~/Documents/Derivative/Startup/ to auto-load TDPilot on every TD launch.
Installed automatically by: npx tdpilot install

Reads ~/.tdpilot_path to find the TDPilot repo root, then either:
  1. Loads the pre-built tdpilot-dpsk4.tox into /local (fast path)
  2. Rebuilds from source if the TOX is missing or stale (fallback)

Never crashes TD startup — all errors are caught and printed to Textport.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TD startup ordering — IMPORTANT (don't relearn the v1.6.5 lesson)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

TD scans ~/Documents/Derivative/Startup/ scripts BEFORE opening the
default project file. So when this module runs:
  - /project1 does NOT exist yet (the .toe hasn't loaded)
  - /local exists but contains nothing the .toe will restore
  - Anything we loadTox into /local gets WIPED a moment later when the
    .toe restore pass overwrites /local with whatever was saved
  - The .toe-restored /project1/tdpilot then binds port 9981, becoming
    the de-facto live MCP bridge — even though we tried to load a fresh
    one earlier in /local

What this means for fixes:
  - The v1.6.5 _find_existing_tdpilot_comps() / _load_tox_fast() sweep
    is BEST-EFFORT only. It catches the simple cases (/local installs,
    no .toe-baked /project1 COMP) but cannot defeat the .toe restore
    that happens AFTER this script runs.
  - The CANONICAL fix shipped in v1.6.6 is for the autostart's save_toe
    handler to set ``externaltox`` on the COMP before saving. That makes
    every future TD launch read the latest .tox content from disk
    instead of restoring a frozen embedded copy. See
    ``td_component/autostart.py:_save_toe_with_externaltox``.
  - If you ever need a Startup-script sweep that runs AFTER the .toe
    loads, use td.run() to defer to a later frame. But prefer the
    externaltox approach — it's stateless and doesn't fight TD's
    project loader.
