"""Thread-safe runtime state cache shared between MCP request handlers and the
in-TD status panel.

The MCP webserver callbacks write to this cache on every request (latency,
last tool name, error counters); the panel COMP reads ``snapshot()`` once a
second to refresh its rows. No MCP round-trip is needed because the panel
lives in the same TD process — both producer and consumer reach the same
module-level dict.

This module is baked into the .tox via build_export_mcp_tox.py's
``_TOX_SOURCE_FILES`` list. Inside TD, it loads as a textDAT named
``state_cache`` inside the ``mcp_server`` baseCOMP and is imported via
``op('/local/tdpilot_dpsk4/mcp_server/state_cache').module``.

History
-------
This file was developed in a v1.6.0 worktree but was never merged to main
until v1.6.7. From v1.5.6 (when the build script switched to the
v1.5.6+ containerCOMP shape) through v1.6.6, fresh ``loadTox`` calls
produced COMPs missing this DAT, so the panel renderer's bootstrap
silently returned False and the textTOP stayed at TD's default
"derivative" placeholder. Users with pre-v1.5.6 installs had a
state_cache baked into older .toe files (from earlier build scripts
that DID create it), so the bug was masked until anyone did a fresh
install or manual destroy + loadTox sequence. v1.6.7 closes the
loop by (a) shipping this file, (b) adding it to ``_TOX_SOURCE_FILES``,
and (c) updating ``_populate_component`` to create the DAT.

Design notes
------------
* Single module-level dict guarded by ``threading.Lock`` — TD HTTP
  callbacks may fire from worker threads, panel poller fires from main.
* ``update()`` accepts arbitrary key/value pairs to keep call sites cheap
  (no schema enforcement at write time). Schema is validated at read time
  in ``snapshot()``.
* ``snapshot()`` returns a deep-copied dict so consumers can't mutate the
  live cache by accident.
* All keys default to None for unset display fields (``or "--"`` chain
  in the renderer falls back through cache → live → "--"); counters
  default to 0 so increment() is a safe no-op before any update.
* Built-in metrics list documented in ``_DEFAULT_KEYS`` — those are the
  fields the panel knows how to render. Extras are kept but not displayed
  unless the panel template references them.
