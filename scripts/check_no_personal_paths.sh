# Block commits that leak hardcoded personal filesystem paths.
#
# Detects macOS-style (``/Users/<name>/``) and Windows-style
# (``C:\Users\<name>\``) paths in tracked files. Linux ``/home/<name>/``
# is also flagged but only when it looks user-named (not generic
# ``/home/user/`` which is commonly used as a placeholder in docs).
#
# This check runs in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and can be wired
# into a local pre-commit hook for fast feedback. Exits 0 on clean,
# 1 on any match.
#
# Remediation when a match is flagged:
#   - Replace with ``<REPO_ROOT>``, ``<USER_HOME>``, ``<USER_DESKTOP>``,
#     ``<DERIVATIVE_DOCS>`` or similar descriptive placeholder
#   - Use ``$HOME``, ``${HOME}`` in shell contexts
#   - Use ``pathlib.Path.home()`` or ``os.path.expanduser("~")`` in code

#   /Users/<name>/             — macOS
#   C:\Users\<name>            — Windows (backslashes escaped 4x for bash+regex)
#   /home/<name>/              — Linux with a user-ish name (alpha-start, 3+ chars)
# The regex character classes after each prefix prevent matching legit
