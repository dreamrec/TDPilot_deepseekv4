"""Fail if the committed ``td_component/tdpilot-dpsk4.tox`` is out of sync with source.

The .tox is a binary TD artifact and can only be rebuilt inside TouchDesigner.
That means after any edit to the `.py` files it embeds, the .tox goes stale
silently — users who install the plugin get outdated callback code.

This guard compares the hash of the source files against the hash recorded in
``td_component/.tox-source-hash.json`` at build time. Mismatch = "rebuild
the .tox in TD before pushing".

Runs in CI. Also runnable locally.
